                <h1>VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE !!!</h1>
                <p>This week we are tackling the age-old mission of 'getting veg into your child'. Anyone else have that
                    problem? I think what I find most frustrating about it is both my wife and I eat pretty much
                    everything and love eating out and trying new food things. Our daughter - the COMPLETE opposite. So,
                    when I decided to trick her meat-eating mind to thinking she was getting bolognese (the meat kind)
                    this vegetable bolognese version needed to both look and taste the part!</p>

                <p>Granted, you miss the meat a bit in it but to be honest I personally think it tastes bloody delicious
                    and she has no trouble wolfing it down so I must have done something right!</p>
                <p>
                <h1>WHAT IS BOLOGNESE</h1>
                Bolognese is a dish that originated in Bologna in, Italy. It is made up of garlic, herbs, tomatoes,
                wine and minced beef. Like everything nowadays there are a million and 1 versions of bolognese (much
                like my vegetable one!). You can use pork mince, veal mince or, in this case, a bucket load of
                veggies.

                <h1>WHAT DO YOU SERVE WITH BOLOGNESE?</h1>
                Bolognese is traditionally served with spaghetti, but to be honest, you can serve it with whatever
                pasta you prefer (don't say that to an Italian!). I've used fettuccine in this dish as I like the
                extra bite you get from the thickness.

                As this vegetable bolognese isn't the traditional kind, I've mixed it up a bit with a few extra
                additions. FYI - my kid doesn't get these additions. I love her, but I don't wanna make basil pesto
                every week!
                </p>

                <p>
                    SO, with that said I top my vegetable bolognese with a spoon of creme fraiche (I know, I know). The
                    fat & acidity in the Creme Fraiche I find really help bind the dish. I also add a dollop of basil
                    pesto and a good sprinkling of homemade breadcrumbs too. All these things add an extra dimension to
                    the dish and honestly take it from an A to an A+ so I would defo give them a go. Plus it DEFO makes
                    it look that little bit fancier too;)

                <h1>WHAT VEGETABLES GO INTO VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE?</h1>
                Aside from the classic base of carrot, onions & garlic, I use whole cauliflower, mushrooms, and some
                dried morels.
                </p>
                <img src="https://www.anotherfoodblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC0307.jpg" width="700px">
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.slofoodgroup.com/products/morel-mushrooms">dried morels</a>(which I picked
                    up from SloFoodGrp) are epic. Soak these guys in warm water for a
                    minimum of 30 minutes (overnight if possible) and watch and taste the extra umami they bring to the
                    dish. Use the liquid from the soaked mushrooms as stock for the sauce and chop the morels up finely.
                    You won't be sorry one bit!

                    Cauliflower is/was the new hip veg. It came in the form of roasted whole, blitzed up like rice or
                    sliced into a big wedge as a "steak". Here we blend it up in the food processor and when cooked with
                    the rest of the veggies and the addition of wine/tomatoes it darkens in colour and almost looks like
                    cooked minced meat. This part is important as kids these days are onto everything we do so it needs
                    to look and taste the part.
                <h1>MAKING VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE</h1>
                The beauty of this vegetable bolognese dish is its simplicity. Simply follow the steps below, and in
                45mins - 1 hour, you have enough to feed an army! Did I mention it freezes great? Whip this up and

                    1. Open and pour some wine!<br>
                    2. Blend all the vegetables together, so they look like mince<br>
                    3. Cook the vegetables in a heavy bottom pan<br>
                    4. Add tomato paste, stock, tinned tomatoes & wine<br>
                    5. Cover and simmer<br>
                    It's really that easy! Check out the recipe card below for the full instructions on how to make my
                    vegetable bolognese!

                <h1>CAN I SUBSTITUTE OTHER DRIED MUSHROOMS IN VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE?</h1>
                <img src="https://www.anotherfoodblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_0900-2.jpg" width="700px">
                <p>
                    You sure can! Truthfully, I like the morel mushroom as aside from being nutty in flavour it is one
                    of the meatier mushrooms so it ties in well to the deceptive part of the dish. Dried porcini is
                    another cracker - nutty, a little more woody in flavour, but equally as good. Dried shiitake
                    mushrooms also work well too.

                    The truth is you can use most dried mushrooms, and nowadays most grocery stores will have them in
                    stock. Given the long shelf life on them, it's always worth having some in the pantry for making
                    some vegetable bolognese or mushroom risotto amongst other things.<br>

                <h1>WINE PAIRING</h1>
                Right, we need 2 bottles of wine for this recipe. 1 to cook with and one to drink. They say that you
                should only cook with what you drink. I'm not gonna lie - I defo struggled to pour this delicious
                Zontes Footsteps Montepulciano into my vegetable bolognese. The truth is, though, it definitely
                helps make this veggie bolognese dish better!<br>
                <img src="https://www.anotherfoodblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC0387.jpg" width="700px">
                <p>
                    The Rosso Cova from Zontes has, like all bottles, beautiful imagery on the label. Given it was a
                    fork of pasta, it seemed the obvious choice to pair these two things together!

                    The wine itself screams food - yes, I enjoyed a glass on its own but with those big tannins, you
                    need something to balance it out. There are TONS of fruit, and I get raspberries, plums &
                    boysenberries. A little herbaceous notes in the form of thyme & oregano. My recommendation with this
                    one is a quick hour in the decanter and enjoy with friends over a big bowl of my vegetable
                    bolognese. It's perfect for any night of the week!
