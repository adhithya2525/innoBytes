                <h1>MOREISH CHOCOLATE BROWNIES</h1>
                <p>This cracking swordfish curry is one I created for Stuart at Little Juniper Gin. The
                    flavours work so
                    well with his signature gin. So, if you are needing a little fish inspiration then look no further
                    than this ðŸ˜‰</p>

                <h1>BLOGGING!!!</h1>
                I have been writing recipes for a few years now and as much as I love cooking and creating dishes I have
                to be honest when I say the part I like the least is writing blog posts. I think it's mainly because as
                a reader of blogs I generally just scroll to the recipe and am less interested in the fluff in between.
                Am I wrong? So, unless any of you guys feel particulary strongly about it going forward I'll just be
                popping up the recipe, a couple images and a small bit of waffle ðŸ˜‰ Plus, less time typing means more
                time cooking so more dishes to choose from!
                All the info you need on this swordfish curry is in the recipe below but if you have any questions, feel
                free to email, message, write a comment or hit me up on insta (usually quicker!)<br><br>
