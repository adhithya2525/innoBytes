                <h1>Easter</h1>
                I wanted to create something a little different this Easter and I wanted to showcase the versatility
                of olive oil alongside one of my favourite snacks - ice cream! This recipe is a "no churn ice cream"
                recipe so I guess you could say it’s a cheats recipe. All I can say is I am glad I don't own an ice
                cream machine or else, well you know!

                When Easter rolls around we consume WAY too much chocolate, lamb and hot cross buns. Eh, said nobody
                ever!! I can't think of 3 nicer things that I'd like to consume on a regular basis. Check out my
                easy carve lamb dish HERE. Definitely one to wow your family with. So, when I was thinking of what
                to make this year I wanted to mix it up a little and that's when I thought about hot cross bun ice
                cream and the rest just kinda fell into place after wandering around the local supermarket for some
                inspiration.

                <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
                There are many different ice cream recipes out there on the web that require eggs, milk, cream, ice
                cream makers and sometimes even a hope & a prayer that it sets or doesn’t crystallize on top. Having
                made this recipe multiple times I can tell you it ain't no Haagen Daz or if you are in Australia,
                like me - Messina gelato, but what I can tell you is it's rich, creamy and sets perfectly
                EVERYTIME!! Not to mention super quick to make too. As it is made with condensed milk it is a little
                sweeter so I added a fruit component to the dish which I think works well to offset the sweetness.
                Also adding a little finishing salt (see tip) to the top of the ice cream before it sets works
                wonders.

                So, without further ado I give you the recipe!!<br>

                        <H3>BANANAS</H3>
                        * 1-2 bananas<br>
                        * 1 tsp brown sugar<br>
                        <h3>TOPPINGS</h3>
                        * peanuts chopped<br>
                        * 1/2 hot cross bun torn into chunks & toasted in the oven (feel free to butter the other half up and eat it!)</P>
                        <hr>
                        <p><b><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></b>
                            <H3>ICE CREAM</H3>
                            - Blend hot cross buns in a food processor, spread onto baking sheet and bake in oven @ 180c for approx 5mins or until crispy.<br>
                            - Mix condensed milk, vanilla & olive oil together in large mixing bowl.<br>
                            - Whisk cream into stiff peaks.<br>
                            - Slowly add cream to condensed milk and fold in gently. This is so that we keep as much air in the cream as possible.<br>
                            - Pour into freezer proof dish, sprinkle with maldon salt & cover tightly with cling wrap. Freeze for a minimum of 6 hrs.<br>
                            - Salted caramel sauce<br>
                            - Place sugar & water in a medium sized sauce pan on a medium heat. Stir until combined and then leave - don't stir it again!<br>
                            - Using a candy thermometer allow sugar to come to a temp of 177c / 350f.<br>
                            - Whisk in butter, being careful as the sugar mixture is very hot and will foam when adding butter.<br>
                            - Remove from heat and gently whisk in cream until combined.<br>
                            - Whisk in salt. Leave to cool for 5 mins before transferring to an airtight container to cool completely.<br>
                            - Once cooled store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Heat before use (see tip)<br>
                            <H3>BANANAS</H3>
                            - Cut bananas lengthways but truthfully you can cut into any shape you like.<br>
                            - Rub the top of banana with brown sugar.<br>
                            - Torch with a blowtorch to brulee tops of bananas (see tip)<br>
                            <H3>TO SERVE</H3>
                            - Heat caramel sauce and swirl sauce on the bottom of the plate.<br>
                            - Place bruleed bananas "artfully"on the plate. Top with ice cream.<br>
                            - Sprinkle peanuts & croutons on top. Drizzle with as much caramel sauce as your blood sugar level can handle.<br>
                            - Attack!</p>
