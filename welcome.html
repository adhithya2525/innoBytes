<p class="normal-spacing">In a nutshell, INNOBYTES is about me, my life in the kitchen, my love & passion for food and about how food features in my life. It’s about what I am cooking right now, what and where I have eaten and how those experiences have inspired me. I chose this title because, yes, there are lots of us food bloggers out there and I'm certainly no Jamie Oliver!! What I am is a hospitality trained home chef who cooks predominantly for a very picky ‘foodie’ wife and a 19 month old princess. What I plan to do is share with you an
    ever evolving collection of dishes that I have cooked and reveal how with a little planning, organization and a well stocked spice drawer you can quite easily elevate homecooked meals to restaurant quality or at least near restaurant quality food, both in terms of taste and presentation. Some dishes may take 20-30mins and some may well take 36hrs (some ribs I did sous vide recently - let's just say the wife was pretty hungry by the time I served dinner that night!). One thing I will say is no matter what I am "throwing" together there is always passion behind my efforts and what's important to me is that I do my utmost to ensure my food looks as good as it tastes! What is it they say - you eat with your eyes? My goal is to present my food to my friends and family so that their first impression is one of excitement.
    In this blog I may share a bit about my travel experiences (which you will find mainly pertain to food anyway!) when the now 19mth old allows something other than a 52nd trip to the di-saur museum!! There may also be the odd recipe for toddler consumption (my apparently tasty tricks for getting veg into an unwilling participant) along with the occasional WTF is going on and why am I awake at 4.30 and neither drunk, in a casino or both rant - yes, I know it’s called ‘being a parent’ but still....
    With a few simple tips & hints throughout the blog I’ll hopefully be able to help you to elevate your plating, inspire you to cook some new things and maybe tweak some dishes you have been cooking for a while and perhaps you will be able offer me some advice on how to further improve some of my own dishes as you try them out! All input and commentary invited and hugely appreciated! Lord knows I don't get much of that at home (my wife has zero desire to cook), ALTHOUGH I do get "it needs something", hmmmmmm ? helpful...!
    Thank you for taking the time to read this, my first blog, and the start of what I hope will continue to be an exciting journey of food exploration!<br><br>
    Happy Cooking and Happy Eating Friends!</p>
