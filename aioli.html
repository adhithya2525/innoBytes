            <h1>HOMEMADE AIOLI</h1>
            <p>This homemade aioli post is a prelude to my next dish.  This may seem to be quite a simple post but sometimes we homecooks get blinded by the bright lights of new & exciting techniques, and we forget the basics.</p>

            <p>You may have heard me mention that the thing I love most about cooking is experimenting.  If you haven't heard it before than prepare to hear it a few more times - sorry!  That said, knowing how to make the classics forms the groundwork for being able to experiment.  Not to mention to expand our repertoire of dishes in our kitchen.  Today in INNOBYTES kitchen here in Brisbane I'll be giving you my recipe for homemade aioli.  Throughout my blog you will see this being used in many different applications. Such as the honey sriracha one I lathered all over my <a href="sweetpotatowedges.html">sweet potato wedges</a>.  So give this a go and trust me when I say my next post will be 100 times easier!!</p>

                * 2 egg yolks<br>

                <hr>
                <p><b><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></b><br>
                - Beat egg yolks, mustard, garlic & lemon together.<br>
                - Gradually add olive oil and continue to beat.<br>
                - Once oil is incorporated, add your seasoning. Aioli should have a smooth & a semi firm consistency.<br>
                - At this point if you want to add any extra flavoring to your aioli then experiment away! In my next post you will see how I make honey sriracha aioli so keep your eyes peeled and don't forget to sign up if you haven't already done so!</p>
