During the monsoon, people crave hot, spicy, and crispy dishes that warm the body and satisfy cravings. Popular monsoon foods include fried snacks like pakoras (vegetable fritters), samosas, and bhajis, which pair perfectly with a hot cup of tea. Soups, stews, and curries made with seasonal vegetables are also favorites, as they provide warmth and nourishment. These dishes often feature spices like ginger, garlic, and chili, which are believed to help boost immunity during the damp, chilly weather.</p><br><br>
