        <p><h1>SWEET POTATOES v YAMS</h1>
            Who doesn't love yummy sweet potatoes?!  Or, are those actually yams? While living in NYC I was always confused by the Yam v Sweet Potato argument.  Why are some called yams and some called sweet potatoes?  Most people I asked gave me the 'it‚Äôs the difference in colour' argument.  While others said 'that's what they are labelled as in the supermarket'.  I have since found out that the majority of 'yams' found in supermarkets were and are in fact just sweet potatoes.  It was deemed (according to research) that the word ‚Äúyam‚Äù was used as a marketing term. Starting way back in the 1930's and it just stuck.  Mainly to do with a need to differentiate them because of the colour, so I guess most people I originally spoke to were correct. Sounds to me like some real FAKE NEWS there!! üôÇ
            
            </p><h1>WHAT IS A SWEET POTATO</h1>
            Now that‚Äôs all sorted, the real difference between sweet potatoes and yams is that in fact they come from different plants.  The sweet potato comes from the morning glory family. It has smooth skin, colours that range from light beige, burnt orange to purple.  Like the name says they are sweet and are less starchy than yams.  Yams, as just mentioned, are drier and starchier therefore require the use of more oil, butter or cream in cooking.  They are related to palms and grasses.  They are typically white fleshed and have a rough hairy-like skin.  So next time you are in the supermarket pay close attention to what you are purchasing.  Because when making this or other dishes as believe me there will be a significant difference in the final product.<br><br><br><br>
            
            Sweet potatoes are fantastic to work with, they are delicious simply mashed with some butter, lend themselves well to being served crushed with scallions & sour cream or, as in this dish, they can be easily grilled on the bbq and complimented nicely by my spicy aioli.  They are best stored in a cool & dry place, where they will last up to a month.  Truthfully I store mine in the fridge.  This actually isn‚Äôt the best place to store them as it can produce a hard center and an unpleasant taste but in the Brisbane heat there is no such thing as a ‚Äúcool, dry place‚Äù!  However, I make sure they are generally only in the fridge for 2-3 days before use and have had no issues to date!</p>

                2. Slowly add oil and continue to beat until a mayonnaise like thickness.<br>
                3. Add sriracha & honey and continue to beat, this will thin it out a little which will make it easier to pour.<br>

                4. Cut potatoes into wedges and lay out on a baking tray. Make sure they are cut evenly so they cook correctly<br>

                5. Heat butter in sauce pan until brown & frothy. This is called brown butter but more on that later. Stir in sugar, salt & cinnamon until dissolved.<br>
